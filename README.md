# Stripe Subscription Demo

A simple Next.js demo showing Stripe subscriptions with feature entitlements, coupons, and promotion codes. No user authentication - just email-based customer matching for demo purposes.

## üéØ What This Does

- Creates tiered subscription plans (Core ¬£3/month, Plus ¬£5/month, Ultra ¬£10/month)
- Shows different features per tier using Stripe's entitlements system
- Handles subscriptions via Stripe Checkout with coupon/promo code support
- Demonstrates discount application with coupons and promotion codes
- Immediate access suspension on payment failures with automatic restoration
- **Discord webhook logging** for subscription events and payment monitoring
- Basic demo - customer identification by email only

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Get Stripe Keys

1. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) 
2. Go to [Dashboard > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
3. Copy your test keys (pk_test_... and sk_test_...)

### 3. Set Up Discord Logging (Optional)

**For subscription event monitoring:**

1. Create a Discord server and channel for logs
2. Create a Discord bot:
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create new application ‚Üí Bot ‚Üí Copy bot token
   - Enable bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Use Slash Commands`
   - Invite bot to your server with these permissions
3. Get your log channel ID:
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings
   - Right-click your log channel ‚Üí Copy ID

### 4. Create `.env` File
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Discord logging (optional)
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
STRIPE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url_here
```

### 5. Set Up Local Webhooks

**Important**: Webhooks don't work in local development by default. You need Stripe CLI:

1. Install [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Login: `stripe login`
3. Forward webhooks to your local server:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```
4. Copy the webhook signing secret from the CLI output to your `.env` file

### 6. Create Products, Features & Discounts
```bash
# Create everything at once (recommended)
pnpm run create:all

# Or create individually:
pnpm run create:feat   # Create features first
pnpm run create:prod   # Then create products
pnpm run create:coup   # Create coupons
pnpm run create:promo  # Create promotion codes
pnpm run create:logs   # Create Discord webhook (optional)
```

### 7. Run the App
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- **Promotion codes** - Test various discount scenarios with provided codes

## üêõ Common Issues

1. **Webhooks not working**: Make sure Stripe CLI is running with `stripe listen`
2. **"Feature not found"**: Run `pnpm run create:feat` first
3. **Products missing**: Run `pnpm run create:prod` after creating features
4. **Coupons not working**: Run `pnpm run create:coup` and `pnpm run create:promo`
5. **Discord logging not working**: Check bot permissions and webhook URL
6. **Need fresh start**: Use `pnpm run wipe` then `pnpm run create:all`

## üîß Discord Setup Tips

- **Channel organization**: Create separate channels for different event types
- **Bot permissions**: Ensure bot has `Send Messages` and `Embed Links` permissions
- **Webhook vs Bot**: Script creates webhook automatically, but you can also use bot token directly
- **Message formatting**: Rich embeds provide better readability than plain text
- **Rate limiting**: Discord has rate limits, but normal subscription volume shouldn't hit them
